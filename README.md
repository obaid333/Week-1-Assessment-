# Week-1-Assessment-
HTML CSS week 1 Day 4 assessment

-HTML and CSS provided by Edx.
-Code altered for an assessment by myself, Obiad Gulzar, as per the assessment.

-I replaced some div tags with section, header and aside in the html.
-I also decreased the amount of css by using multiple tags in one line.
-I could not get display:grid; to work for the aside, as they Images would go outside of their parent box.
